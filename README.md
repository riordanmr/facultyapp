Recreation in JavaScript of David Gries's Java FacultyApplet

This is a recreation, in HTML and JavaScript, of Davis Gries's FacultyApplet, a Java applet which displays a list of Cornell Computer Science Department faculty members.
See the original at https://www.cs.cornell.edu/gries/facultyunix/first.html.

The motivation behind this rewrite is to support modern browsers; these days, browsers won't run Java applets.
